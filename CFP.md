### SUBMISSIONS
We invite papers of different types such as *experimental papers*, *reproduction papers*, *resource papers*, *position papers*, *survey papers*. 

Both long and short papers describing original and unpublished work are welcome. 
**Long papers** should deal with substantial completed research and/or report the development of new methodologies. They may consist of up to 8 pages of content plus 2 pages of references. **Short papers** are instead appropriate for reporting on works in progress or for describing a singular tool or project. They may consist of up to 4 pages of content plus 2 pages of references. We encourage the authors of papers reporting experimental results to make their results reproducible and the entire process of analysis replicable, by making it available the data and the tools they used. The form of the presentation may be oral or poster, whereas in the proceedings there is no difference between the accepted papers.

The submission is anonymous. The [LREC official format](https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/submission2020/authors-kit/) is requested. Each paper will be reviewed but three independent reviewers.

### SHARE YOUR LRs!
When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your research.
Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC authors to share the described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.) to enable their reuse and replicability of experiments (including evaluation ones)".
