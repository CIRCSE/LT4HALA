### SUBMISSIONS
We invite papers of different types such as *experimental papers*, *reproduction papers*, *resource papers*, *position papers*, *survey papers*. 

Both long and short papers describing original and unpublished work are welcome. 
**Long papers** should deal with substantial completed research and/or report the development of new methodologies. They may consist of up to 8 pages of content plus 2 pages of references. **Short papers** are instead appropriate for reporting on works in progress or for describing a singular tool or project. They may consist of up to 4 pages of content plus 2 pages of references. We encourage the authors of papers reporting experimental results to make their results reproducible and the entire process of analysis replicable, by making it available the data and the tools they used. The form of the presentation may be oral or poster, whereas in the proceedings there is no difference between the accepted papers.

The submission is anonymous. The [LREC official format](https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/submission2020/authors-kit/) is requested. Each paper will be reviewed but three independent reviewers.

### SHARE YOUR LRs!
Describing your LRs in the [LRE Map](http://lremap.elra.info/) is now a normal practice in the submission procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other conferences). To continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about “Sharing LRs” (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibility,  when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository.  This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new “regular” feature for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and share data.

### ISLRN number
As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2020 endorses the need to uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the International Standard Language Resource Number ([ISLRN](www.islrn.org)), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC papers  will be offered at submission time.
